# Fluid_Simulation_Using_Laplacian_Eigenfunctions
This repository contains my implementation of the paper "Fluid Simulation Using Laplacian Eigenfunctions" by Tyler De Witt, Adam Bargteil, and Ladislav Kavan. The paper can be found [here](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~elf/.misc/a10-witt.pdf).
It is a final project for CS 384G - Computer Graphics at the University of Texas at Austin.
